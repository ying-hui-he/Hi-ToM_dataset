Question: Where is the melon really?
Answer: green_bathtub
Choices: A. green_bathtub, B. green_cupboard, C. green_bucket, D. blue_pantry, E. green_basket, F. blue_suitcase, G. green_box, H. red_pantry, I. blue_bottle, J. red_container, K. blue_bathtub, L. red_bottle, M. green_bottle, N. red_bucket, O. red_drawer

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: green_bathtub
GPT-4 Explain: To solve this question, we need to track the movements of the agents and the location of the melon. According to the story, the melon was initially in the green_bathtub, then moved to the blue_pantry by Aiden, then to the green_bucket by Emma, and finally to the green_bathtub by Isla. Therefore, the melon is actually in the green_bathtub. The answer is A.
