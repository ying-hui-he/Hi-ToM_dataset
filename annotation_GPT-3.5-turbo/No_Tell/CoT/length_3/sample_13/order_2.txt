Question: Where does Emily think William thinks the corn is?
Answer: green_bathtub
Choices: A. blue_bottle, B. red_drawer, C. red_bottle, D. blue_container, E. red_bucket, F. green_bucket, G. red_pantry, H. green_drawer, I. blue_treasure_chest, J. green_envelope, K. green_bathtub, L. red_envelope, M. green_cupboard, N. green_bottle, O. blue_crate

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: green_bathtub
GPT-4 Explain: To answer this question, we need to track the movements of William and the corn. William initially moved the corn from the green_bathtub to the green_cupboard, but later made no movements and stayed in the pantry for a minute before exiting. Emily then moved the corn from the green_cupboard to the red_envelope before exiting the pantry. Isla then moved the corn from the red_envelope to the green_bottle before exiting the pantry. Jackson then moved the corn from the green_bottle back to the green_bathtub before exiting the pantry. 

Based on these movements, Emily would know that William moved the corn from the green_bathtub to the green_cupboard, but she would not know that he later made no movements and stayed in the pantry for a minute. Therefore, she would think that William still believes the corn is in the green_cupboard. 

The answer is M. green_cupboard.
