Question: Where does Abigail really think the peach is?
Answer: red_pantry
Choices: A. red_container, B. blue_crate, C. green_crate, D. blue_pantry, E. green_treasure_chest, F. blue_cupboard, G. green_bottle, H. blue_suitcase, I. green_box, J. blue_bucket, K. red_envelope, L. red_bucket, M. red_crate, N. red_pantry, O. green_cupboard

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: red_pantry
GPT-4 Explain: To answer this question, we need to track Abigail's movements and any private or public interactions she had regarding the peach. According to the story, Abigail made no movements when the peach was initially in the red_bucket, and she exited the hallway before Aiden moved the peach to the red_pantry. Later, when Benjamin privately told her that the peach is in the red_pantry, she made no movements and exited the hallway. Therefore, based on the given assumptions, we can infer that Abigail did not have any private or public interactions regarding the peach after Benjamin told her its location. So, Abigail really thinks that the peach is in the red_pantry. The answer is N. red_pantry.
