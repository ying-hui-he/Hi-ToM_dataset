(4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: red_container
GPT-4 Answer: red_container
GPT-4 Explain: Answer: L. red_container

Explanation: Liam was the one who moved the tomato to the green_drawer in step 9. However, Emma exited the study in step 5, before Liam moved the tomato. So, from Emma's perspective, the tomato is still in the red_container. Since Liam was in the study when Emma exited, he knows that Emma's last known location of the tomato was the red_container. Therefore, Liam thinks Emma thinks the tomato is in the red_container.
