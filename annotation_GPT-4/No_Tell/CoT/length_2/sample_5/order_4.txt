Question: Where does Noah think Emma thinks Aiden thinks Avery thinks the cabbage is?
Answer: green_box
Choices: A. red_envelope, B. green_envelope, C. green_box, D. blue_bucket, E. blue_pantry, F. green_basket, G. blue_drawer, H. red_container, I. green_bucket, J. green_bathtub, K. red_box, L. green_crate, M. blue_container, N. green_drawer, O. red_bottle

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: green_box
GPT-4 Answer: green_envelope
GPT-4 Explain: B. green_envelope

Explanation:
1. Noah saw the cabbage being moved to the green_box (step 3) and then left the staircase (step 5).
2. Emma didn't make any movements and left the staircase (step 7) without knowing the cabbage's location change.
3. Avery moved the cabbage to the green_envelope (step 20) and exited the staircase (step 21).
4. Aiden didn't make any movements and left the staircase (step 19) after Avery, so he would trust Avery's action and believe the cabbage is in the green_envelope.
5. Since Noah and Emma haven't interacted with Aiden or Avery after they exited the staircase, they wouldn't know about the cabbage's location change to the green_envelope.

So, Noah thinks Emma thinks Aiden thinks Avery thinks the cabbage is in the green_envelope.
